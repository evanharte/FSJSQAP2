You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below in whatever way you can but please answer the following questions/points as part of your submission:

1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

              approx. 5 hours.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
  
              I used mostly my own coding notes taken from your lectures and some help with the syntax from github copilot.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

              No, I did not ask any of my friends for help.

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

              No, I did not ask any questions to any of my instructors.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one.

              I felt that all 3 parts of this QAP were equal in difficulty. I would rate them each as 8/10 (easy). I feel confident that I can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that I’ve completed this one.
